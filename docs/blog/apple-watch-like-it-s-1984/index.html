          <h2>Apple Watch Like It&#x27;s 1984</h2>
        </header>
        <p>Maybe you’ve considered buying a shiny new Apple Watch, but you find it’s modern aesthetic and functionality a bit lacking. Don’t you wish it was more like the old <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_II_series">Apple II</a>? Today is your lucky day. Aleator777 of Instructables has written a detailed tutorial on how to build your own <a href="http://www.instructables.com/id/Apple-II-Watch/?ALLSTEPS">Apple II Watch</a>. It’s as cool as it sounds, but you’ll need a working knowledge of electronics and a 3D printer to follow along.</p>
<p>The final result sports a 3D-printed shell inspired by the classic computer and even mimics the original boot sequence. Most of the watch functionality is just a series of fun little graphic demos, but it does <em>actually tell the time.</em></p>
<p>The parody aspect of this project is hilarious. There’s a fun marketing video and even a fake press release. My favorite bit from the press release:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The CATHODE RAY TUBE display on Apple // watch features TEXT, a technology that ALLOWS YOU TO READ, providing a new way to quickly and easily access BASIC PROGRAMS.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But all joking aside, this is just a really cool project. They totally nailed the early Apple aesthetic — the 7/8” floppy disk is a great touch, and that beige nylon band is just perfect. The person who made it shared all of the source files for the 3D printed parts, too. I doubt if I’ll ever get into 3D printing myself, but I’m pretty fascinated by it. I could go on about the potential for democratize manufacturing and how cool it is to basically download a physical object, but I think I’ll save that for a future blog post.</p>
