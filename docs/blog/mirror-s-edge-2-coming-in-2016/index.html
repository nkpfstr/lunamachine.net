          <h2>Mirror&#x27;s Edge 2 Coming In 2016</h2>
        </header>
        <p>Michael McWhertor <a href="http://www.polygon.com/2015/5/5/8556395/mirrors-edge-2-release-date">for Polygon</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The new Mirror’s Edge from developer DICE will be released in early 2016, publisher Electronic Arts confirmed today.
EA lists the game for release during the first three months of 2016 in a financial earnings presentation, saying the game is coming to consoles and PC.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hopefully this means we’ll start seeing heavier marketing soon, perhaps starting at E3 2015. I am a huge fan of the original game, but I remain cautiously optimistic about this one. It looks very promising from what little we’ve seen so far, but I’m reserving much of my excitement for when DICE goes more in-depth with story and game mechanics. I’m also a little scared of pre-order/DLC hell destroying this game’s integrity. Here’s hoping for a good E3 in June.</p>
