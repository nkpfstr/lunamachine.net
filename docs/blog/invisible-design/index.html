        <p>David Pierce interviewed Apple’s human interface chief Alan Dye about the design process behind the Apple Watch’s customizable faces for <a href="http://www.wired.com/2015/04/apple-watch-design">this great Wired article</a>. The turning point for me:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Yet what Dye seems most fascinated by is one of the Apple Watch’s faces, called Motion, which you can set to show a flower blooming. Each time you raise your wrist, you’ll see a different color, a different flower. This is not CGI. It’s photography.
“We shot all this stuff,” Dye says, “the butterflies and the jellyfish and the flowers for the motion face, it’s all in-camera. And so the flowers were shot blooming over time. I think the longest one took us 285 hours, and over 24,000 shots.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I love hearing about the process behind features like this. The design thinking that went into these watch faces is truly something to behold.</p>
