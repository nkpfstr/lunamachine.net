          <h2>Welcome to Macintosh</h2>
        </header>
        <p>I discovered a great new podcast this week called <a href="http://www.macintosh.fm/">Welcome to Macintosh</a>. It’s full of great insights and funny stories from people who have made much of their careers thanks to Apple products. There’s only 3 episodes so far and they’re about 20 minutes each, so you can catch up in about an hour. If you’re an audio nerd and you only listen to one episode, make it <a href="http://www.macintosh.fm/episodes/3">episode 3</a>. Guest Charlie Kellner talks about his alphaSyntauri synthesizer and how it was used to make sound effects for TRON, talk to dolphins and even led him to a meeting with his hero, Bob Moog.</p>
<p>Creator Mark Bramhill set out to create a podcast that married the subject of Apple with the artistry of shows like 99% Invisible, This American Life and Radiolab. So far, I think he’s doing a great job. You can support the podcast on <a href="https://www.patreon.com/macintoshfm">Patreon</a>.</p>
