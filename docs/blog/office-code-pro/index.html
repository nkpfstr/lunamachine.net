          <h2>Office Code Pro</h2>
        </header>
        <p>Source Code Pro used to be my favorite coding typeface, but then I found <a href="http://input.fontbureau.com/">Input</a> by Font Bureau. I switched for the incredible flexibility and the unique sans-serif and serif alternates, which worked surprisingly well with code. Input has been great to code with overall, but I was beginning to miss the personality of Source Code Pro.</p>
<p>Today I discovered Nathan Rutzky’s <a href="https://github.com/nathco/Office-Code-Pro">Office Code Pro</a>, a custom version of Source Code Pro. From the readme:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Office Code Pro is a customized version of the Source Code Pro type family, originally created for Adobe Systems Incorporated by Paul D. Hunt. The customizations were made specifically for text editors and coding environments, but are still very usable in other applications.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is basically everything I loved about Source Code Pro and nothing I didn’t. Really great work from Nathan and I highly recommend trying it out.</p>
