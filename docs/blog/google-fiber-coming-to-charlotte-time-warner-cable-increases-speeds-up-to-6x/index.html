          <h2>Google Fiber Coming to Charlotte, Time Warner Cable Increases Speeds up to 6x</h2>
        </header>
        <p>It seems like it’s become customary for cable providers to dramatically increase their customers’ broadband internet speeds for free whenever Google Fiber announces plans to expand into their territory. According to <a href="http://arstechnica.com/business/2015/04/google-fiber-plans-expansion-then-twc-makes-speeds-six-times-faster/">Jon Brodkin’s report</a> for Ars Technica, it’s no different for Time Warner Cable customers in Charlotte, North Carolina:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The Internet transformation will begin this summer and will include speed increases on TWC residential Internet plans at no additional cost, with customers experiencing increases up to six times faster, depending on their current level of Internet service,” Time Warner Cable announced last week. “For example, customers who subscribe to Standard, formerly up to 15Mbps, will now receive up to 50Mbps, customers who subscribe to Extreme, formerly up to 30Mbps, will now receive up to 200Mbps; and customers who subscribe to Ultimate, formerly up to 50Mbps, will receive up to 300Mbps, at no extra charge.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Comcast doubled my speed from 25Mbps to 50Mbps for free just a few months after Google Fiber announced plans to expand to Portland. It’s funny how <em>the mere possibility</em> of competing with Google Fiber sends these cable behemoths into a frenzy.</p>
