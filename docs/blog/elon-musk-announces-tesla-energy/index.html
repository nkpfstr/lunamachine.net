          <h2>Elon Musk Announces Tesla Energy</h2>
        </header>
        <p>Elon Musk has been teasing a new product announcement for a while, and last night he delivered. He announced <a href="http://www.teslamotors.com/powerwall">Tesla Energy</a>, which is billed as “a suite of batteries for homes, businesses, and utilities fostering a clean energy ecosystem and helping wean the world off fossil fuels.” What really got me excited was the long term vision Elon was pitching to the crowd:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What if we could move the electricity grid off of fossil fuels and towards renewable energy sources?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>True to his ambitious nature, Elon proposes that Tesla Energy is a sound plan for getting <em>the entire world</em> off of fossil fuels. His presentation was rather impactful. At one point, Elon proposed that with a program like this, the entire United States could be powered by a solar grid no larger than the top square section of Texas.</p>
<p>But the coolest moment by far was when he casually revealed that the entire event - the huge displays, the lighting, the cameras and essentially the entire building - were all being powered by a set of Tesla Powerwall batteries sitting outside hooked up to solar panels on the roof.</p>
<p>You can reserve a Tesla Powerwall home battery for $3,500 today, and they’re expected to ship this summer. If I could, I would.</p>
