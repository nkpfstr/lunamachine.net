          <h2>It&#x27;s About the Process</h2>
        </header>
        <p>I messed up. Last Friday, I procrastinated blogging to the point that I never got around to it. I did that four days in a row. Thirty two days in, my streak is broken.</p>
<p>When I first sat down to write this post, I was <em>really</em> disappointed in myself. I was ready to retroactively add 5 posts to my blog to make up for the days I missed. Then I remembered a passage from the 100 Day Project website, and I changed my mind. It went something like this:</p>
<p><em><strong>But what if I fail?</strong></em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>You will.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em><strong>And then what?</strong></em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>You get to decide if you keep doing this.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I’m not going to ret-con my blog. Instead, I’m just writing today’s post. This post. I’m going to own my mistakes, deal with the fact that I won’t finish this with 100 blog posts and keep marching forward. In the end, the number of posts doesn’t matter; it’s all about the process.</p>
