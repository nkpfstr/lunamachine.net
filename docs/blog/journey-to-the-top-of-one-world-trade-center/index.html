          <h2>Journey to the Top of One World Trade Center</h2>
        </header>
        <p>The new One World Trade Center building opens its observation decks to the public in May, but you can <a href="http://qz.com/387024/the-breathtaking-elevator-ride-to-the-top-of-one-world-trade-center-sweeps-through-515-years-of-history/">watch a video</a> right now that takes you on a rather unique ride to the top.</p>
<p>The elevator is fitted with nine 75-inch screens spanning three of the inner walls. As you ascend towards the observation decks at 23 miles per hour, the screens reveal a simulated, panoramic view of Manhattan that takes you on a journey through the city’s 515 years of history. In the 47-second trip, you will see everything from Native American villages to the first skyscrapers. There’s a moment when the Twin Towers briefly appear, only to eerily vanish seconds later. As the ride concludes, the view is enveloped by the construction of the very building you’re in.</p>
<p>The new building has its critics — understandably so — but even living vicariously through this early video tour, I found this to be a pretty stunning experience. It must be surreal to actually ride this elevator; especially for people who stepped foot in the original towers.</p>
