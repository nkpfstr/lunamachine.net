          <h2>Silent Hills is Dead</h2>
        </header>
        <p>After hearing yesterday that P.T. was being pulled from the PlayStation Store, I figured it was only a matter of time. Unfortunately, that doesn’t make this any easier to swallow.</p>
<p>This morning, Konami confirmed that <em>Silent Hills</em> <a href="http://www.polygon.com/2015/4/27/8503201/silent-hills-canceled-konami-confirms">is dead</a>. As if I wasn’t already worried about the future of the <em>Silent Hill</em> franchise, Konami’s attempt to fan the flames just makes it worse:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Konami is committed to new Silent Hill titles, however the embryonic Silent Hills project developed with Guillermo del Toro and featuring the likeness of Norman Reedus will not be continued,” according to the statement provided to Polygon.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That’s not exactly reassuring coming from the company that brought us <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/silent-hill-the-escape-us/id300626088?mt=8">this gem</a>.</p>
<p><em>What the hell is happening at Konami?</em></p>
<p>Between this, the removal of P.T. and the bizarre erasure of Kojima Productions’ existence, many of us are anxious about Hideo Kojima’s future as a game developer. The running theory seems to be that Kojima Productions had a disagreement with Konami, prompting the companies to part ways. The nature of that disagreement is anyone’s guess. Many suspect a creative rift or financial dispute, it seems, but I wonder if it’s bigger than that.</p>
