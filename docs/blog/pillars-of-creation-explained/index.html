          <h2>Pillars of Creation Explained</h2>
        </header>
        <p>Vox has <a href="http://www.vox.com/2015/4/24/8482327/pillars-of-creation-hubble">a great feature</a> that explains a lot of what you see in the Pillars of Creation, probably the most famous image ever taken by the Hubble telescope. I recommend enjoying it in full screen on a desktop if you can.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>These gigantic towers of dust and gas, 7,000 light years away, are named because the immense force of gravity causes them to condense into clumps of matter that will become new star systems. In fact, billions of years ago our own solar system may have been born through the same process — so when you look at this upgraded 2014 version of the image, you’re also looking back at the very distant history of Earth.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It’s incredible how much we can learn about the universe just by looking up.</p>
