          <h2>Introducing Harmon</h2>
        </header>
        <p>Modular scales are becoming more common in web design today. As far as I know, using a modular scale in web design was popularized by <a href="https://twitter.com/timbrown">Tim Brown</a>, a Type Manager at Typekit. In his <em>A List Apart</em> article on the subject, Tim explains what a modular scale is and why we might want to use one:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A modular scale is a sequence of numbers that relate to one another in a meaningful way. […]</p>
<p>By using culturally relevant, historically pleasing ratios to create modular scales and basing the measurements in our compositions on values from those scales, we can achieve a visual harmony not found in layouts that use arbitrary, conventional, or easily divisible numbers.</p>

<p>I like using a modular scale in my Sass projects to maintain harmony and vertical rhythm. There is a well-known modular scale calculator made with Sass — aptly named <a href="">modularscale-sass</a> — but I often find it to be more than I need. I’ve been using my own little scale that I cobbled together a few projects ago, and this weekend I decided to clean it up and release it on Github for everyone to use. I call it Harmon.</p>
<p>Harmon is a simple typographic scale written in Sass. My goal was to make it as straight forward as using <a href="http://modularscale.com">modularscale.com</a>. It’s easy to configure &amp; use, and it’s lightweight at under 3kb. It outputs rems by default, but you can optionally output unitless values (useful for line heights). You can travel 6 steps down the scale or 16 steps up; Harmon will throw an error if you go outside of that range.</p>
<p>You can download Harmon <a href="https://github.com/nickpfisterer/harmon">on Github</a> or install it with Bower <code>bower install harmon --save</code>. Check out the <a href="https://github.com/nickpfisterer/harmon/blob/master/README.md">README</a> for instructions and feel free to <a href="https://github.com/nickpfisterer/harmon/issues">submit an issue</a> if you find a bug or have a suggestion.</p>

<p>Funny story about the name. I was going to call it Harmony, but when I went to add Bower support I saw that there was already a packaged called Harmony (the Bower registry is first-come, first-serve). I didn’t want to spend a lot of time on a new name, so I just chopped off the ‘y’ in Harmony. When I said it out loud, it sounded catchy. So I stuck with it.</p>
