          <h2>Fallout 4 Announced</h2>
        </header>
        <p>Bethesda announced <em>Fallout 4</em> with a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE2BkLqMef4">teaser trailer</a> this morning, and it looks like we’re heading to Boston this time.</p>
<p>It’s a hype trailer focused on setting the tone and showing off the new graphics, so details on story and gameplay are scarce. I expect to learn more when they premiere the game at E3 on June 14. It will be streamed live on YouTube and Twitch.</p>
<p>I really dig the sound work at the end of the trailer; when the <em>Fallout 4</em> logo appears, the light bulb in the center lights up and the sound you would expect an old light bulb to make matches the tone of the background music. It’s a great effect.</p>
<p>I really enjoyed <em>Fallout 3</em> (and <em>Fallout: New Vegas</em> to a lesser extent) thanks to its open-ended exploration and rich atmosphere. Even though the color palette rarely changed, the creators of <em>Fallout 3</em> managed to create several memorable locations throughout the vast landscape. That’s a tough thing to do when you’re designing levels for a nuclear wasteland.</p>
<p>What really made <em>Fallout 3</em> for me, though, was playing it on PC with mods. Minimal HUD, high resolution texture packs, darker nights and more vibrant, realistic colors turned this game into a very immersive experience. I can’t imagine playing it any other way. The art style presented in the teaser trailer for <em>Fallout 4</em> looks good - far more colorful than previous games - so I’m hopeful that some mods won’t even be necessary this time around. I can almost guarantee I’ll still play with a minimal HUD mod, though.</p>
