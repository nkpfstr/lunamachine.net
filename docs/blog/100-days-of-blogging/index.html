          <h2>100 Days of Blogging</h2>
        </header>
        <p>Welcome to my first post for The Great Discontent’s <a href="http://thegreatdiscontent.com/100days">100 Day Project</a>! I have chosen a simple challenge, but what that holds meaning for me: Write a blog post every day for 100 days.</p>
<p>I’ve tried to start a blog several times over the past few years. None of them got past the first post. I always had an excuse for why I didn’t have time to write, and after a while, I would just give up and move on to other things. <strong>Not today, folks.</strong></p>
<p>The 100 Day Project gives me a great opportunity to prove to myself that there is <em>no reason</em> why I can’t write something every day. I’m keeping this simple to minimize the possibility of me making an excuse, but I do have a few rules:</p>
<ul>
<li>Write one post every day. No more, no less.</li>
<li>No restrictions on word count.</li>
<li>I have a lot of passions in life, but I’m going to try to focus on video games and technology.</li>
</ul>
<p>I will also be actively tweaking and improving the design of this site throughout the project, so don’t be too surprised if things feel a little different from day to day. You can track the source code <a href="https://github.com/nickpfisterer/its-nicks-source">on Github</a> if you’re interested in that kind of thing.</p>
<p>I’m kind of nervous that I will fail again. I worry that my writing sucks and that no one will care. But that’s the trick, isn’t it? Like many before me, I need to learn how to embrace failure as a learning opportunity and grow from it. The only way I can get better at writing is to keep writing. So if you don’t mind, I’m just going to shut up and write.</p>
