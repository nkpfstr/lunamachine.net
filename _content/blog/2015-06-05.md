If you're a regular Skype user, you might want to check out the new [Skype for Web](http://web.skype.com) beta. The set up is pretty clunky - you need to install _two_ plugins to use it - but once you're in, it's a pretty familiar experience.

It's not a full replacement for the desktop app yet (that may change when it leaves beta), but it means you can use Skype on, say, a Google Chromebook.
