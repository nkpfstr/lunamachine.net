title: Necromancer Elite Specialization Announced - The Reaper

This morning, ArenaNet announced the first elite specialization for the necromancer: [the reaper](https://www.guildwars2.com/en/news/meet-the-reaper-necromancers-elite-specialization/). I'm still collecting my thoughts about this, so I'm going to reserve a more detailed reaction for tomorrow after the Points of Interest live stream where they will be showing the reaper in action. Until then, check out the official blog post for more info.
