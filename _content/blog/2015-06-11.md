Microsoft has been making a lot of improvements under their new CEO, Satya Nadella, and this morning they [announced](http://blogs.skype.com/2015/06/11/a-more-efficient-skype-experience-for-your-pc/) one that I have been hoping for:

> Starting on July 7, weâ€™re updating PC users of the Windows modern application to the Windows desktop application, and retiring the modern application.

It always bothered me that the "modern app" version of Skype on Windows 8+ didn't have screen sharing, so I'm excited to see this change.
