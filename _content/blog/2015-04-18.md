Wow. So today I discovered that Pizza Hut still maintains a live copy of their [first website](http://www.pizzahut.com/assets/pizzanet/home.html). What trip back in time! If you're familiar with HTML and CSS, do yourself a favor and check out the source code. Inline styles, table-based layouts and font tags abound.

One piece of copy really caught my attention:

> You may click on the Pizza Hut logo on any page to submit comments regarding PizzaNet to webmaster@Pizzahut.COM.

Obviously making websites was a lot different back then, but even now I don't think I've ever seen this design pattern. I wonder: was this a common pattern in the 90s? Was there a time when users expected this behavior? I guess I'm just used to the modern paradigm of clicking a logo to go to the homepage, but the idea of clicking a logo to submit user feedback is kind of fascinating to me.
