Disney released [a new teaser](https://youtu.be/ngElkyQ6Rhs) for Star Wars: The Force Awakens today. I love it. Classic John Williams score, skillful editing and a tone much closer to that of the original trilogy. There are more hints about the story this time around, and plenty of nostalgia for long-time fans (especially the ending). Why are you still reading? Watch the trailer already!
