title: Epic Games Talks Business And Legal Tips For Unreal Developers
date: 2015-05-03

Last week, Epic Games hosted [a Twitch live stream](https://youtu.be/-C3x2Otc8sw) covering business and legal tips for Unreal Engine developers. They covered a huge variety of important topics ranging from licensing, trademark and IP ownership to crowdfunding, getting a lawyer and working with a publisher. These are all topics that many of us neglect when we shouldn't.  Tons of valuable info, even if you're not using Unreal Engine.

If you are an indie game developer wondering how to set up your business, this is a must watch.
