title: You Can Still Download P.T. If You Already Purchased It

The fact that so many people will miss out on P.T. is still tremendously sad, but there's a silver lining: [according to Polygon](http://www.polygon.com/2015/4/30/8521741/pt-re-download-playstation-store-delisted), if you already 'purchased' P.T. before it was taken down, you can still re-download it. _Thank goodness._

This comes as a relief to me because, as someone who doesn't yet own a PlayStation 4, I quickly added P.T. to my account via the PSN website. Good to know my efforts weren't in vain.
