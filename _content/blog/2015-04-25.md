Local Portland software developer Panic, known for Mac apps such as Transmit and Coda, are always up to something cool. They recently set up a website that lets you change the colors of their sign _right from your phone._

> Founded in Portland in 1997, it took Panic 15 years to get a sign. We want it to be Portlandâ€™s sign, too. Come down to SW 10th & Burnside at night, and go on, change our colors!

I definitely have to try this next time I go downtown. It's things like this that make me love Panic.
