Rene Ritchie at iMore has one of the very first Apple Watch [unboxing videos](https://youtu.be/9rqF9uR82lU). My only complaint is that he moves through it very quickly and doesn't stop to smell the roses very much. Regardless, it's just very exciting to see the first unboxing videos coming out. This is a brand new product line from Apple, which always makes for an exciting launch.

Besides: get a load of that beautiful space gray MacBook in the background.
