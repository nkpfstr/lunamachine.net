title: Elon Musk Announces Tesla Energy

Elon Musk has been teasing a new product announcement for a while, and last night he delivered. He announced [Tesla Energy](http://www.teslamotors.com/powerwall), which is billed as "a suite of batteries for homes, businesses, and utilities fostering a clean energy ecosystem and helping wean the world off fossil fuels." What really got me excited was the long term vision Elon was pitching to the crowd:

> What if we could move the electricity grid off of fossil fuels and towards renewable energy sources?

True to his ambitious nature, Elon proposes that Tesla Energy is a sound plan for getting _the entire world_ off of fossil fuels. His presentation was rather impactful. At one point, Elon proposed that with a program like this, the entire United States could be powered by a solar grid no larger than the top square section of Texas.

But the coolest moment by far was when he casually revealed that the entire event - the huge displays, the lighting, the cameras and essentially the entire building - were all being powered by a set of Tesla Powerwall batteries sitting outside hooked up to solar panels on the roof.

You can reserve a Tesla Powerwall home battery for $3,500 today, and they're expected to ship this summer. If I could, I would.
