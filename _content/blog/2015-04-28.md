Vox's Joseph Stromberg sat down with astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson for [a great interview](http://www.vox.com/2015/4/28/8489725/neil-degrasse-tyson) about space, fame and the future of our species. At one point Neil is asked about what he thinks the U.S. should be doing in space. His response quickly reveals just how much he loves to explore the universe:

> I have an unorthodox answer to that. We're used to picking and choosing what to do in space. But it shouldn't be about a particular destination, or a specific project getting priority. We should be turning the entire solar system into our backyard.
