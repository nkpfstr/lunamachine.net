Polycount users ACeye and Desmera created [this stunning scene](http://www.polycount.com/2015/04/09/the-throne-room-1st-place-winner/) for a game art contest using Unreal Engine 4 and Allegorithmic's Substance suite of texturing tools. The result is jaw-dropping. Unsurprisingly, they took first place.

On that note, I recommend taking a look around Polycount if you're interested in stuff like this. Some of the most skilled 2D and 3D artists out there share their work on the forums, including progress updates and tips for other artists to learn from.
