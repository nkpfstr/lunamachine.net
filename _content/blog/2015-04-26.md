title: PT is Leaving the PlayStation Store

I can't believe I'm writing this. On April 29, 2015 Konami will remove P.T. (Playable Teaser) from the PlayStation Store. **If you haven't played it, download it now while you still have the chance.** This warning message appears on the official website:

> The distribution period of "P.T. (Playable Teaser)" on PlayStationÂ®Store will expire on Wednesday, April 29, 2015.

What started as a mysterious, free horror game from the fictional 7780s Studios turned out to be a clever promotion for the upcoming _Silent Hills_, a Silent Hill title from the minds of Hideo Kojima and Guillermo Del Toro. A free, experimental, short-form horror game spawned countless Let's Play videos and became one of the most critically acclaimed video games of 2014. I have a lot to say about P.T. that I've been saving for a good long blog post. Wednesday seems like a good day to finally write that post.

That's about as much as I can articulate for now. I leave you with Patrick Klepek's thoughts on the matter via Twitter:

> This is terrible. PT is already a horror classic, and knowing millions will never play it makes me tremendously sad.
