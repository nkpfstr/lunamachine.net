title: Journey to the Top of One World Trade Center

The new One World Trade Center building opens its observation decks to the public in May, but you can [watch a video](http://qz.com/387024/the-breathtaking-elevator-ride-to-the-top-of-one-world-trade-center-sweeps-through-515-years-of-history/) right now that takes you on a rather unique ride to the top.

The elevator is fitted with nine 75-inch screens spanning three of the inner walls. As you ascend towards the observation decks at 23 miles per hour, the screens reveal a simulated, panoramic view of Manhattan that takes you on a journey through the city's 515 years of history. In the 47-second trip, you will see everything from Native American villages to the first skyscrapers. There's a moment when the Twin Towers briefly appear, only to eerily vanish seconds later. As the ride concludes, the view is enveloped by the construction of the very building you're in.

The new building has its critics — understandably so — but even living vicariously through this early video tour, I found this to be a pretty stunning experience. It must be surreal to actually ride this elevator; especially for people who stepped foot in the original towers.
