Twitterrific [announced](http://blog.iconfactory.com/2015/04/twitterrific-for-apple-watch/) the Apple Watch version of their popular Twitter client. Like Apple, though, they're not just taking their existing product and shrinking it down to fit on your wrist. They've taken a whole new approach here that looks to be in line with the notion that most interactions with Apple Watch happen in seconds, not minutes. I particularly like their approach to glances. From the announcement:

> Twitterrific’s glance gives you a fun, visual digest of the total number of favorites, retweets and new followers you’ve received over the past 24 hours. Think of it as a lightweight version of the Today View from the iOS app. It also displays the number of unread tweets currently waiting for you the next time you launch the iOS app.

This sounds really useful to me. I already use the Today View a lot because it's much faster and easier to parse than, say, checking an analytics dashboard or manually combing through notifications. With the Apple Watch app, I'll be able to do that without even taking my phone out of my pocket.
