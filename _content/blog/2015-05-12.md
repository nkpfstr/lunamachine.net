I messed up. Last Friday, I procrastinated blogging to the point that I never got around to it. I did that four days in a row. Thirty two days in, my streak is broken.

When I first sat down to write this post, I was _really_ disappointed in myself. I was ready to retroactively add 5 posts to my blog to make up for the days I missed. Then I remembered a passage from the 100 Day Project website, and I changed my mind. It went something like this:

_**But what if I fail?**_

> You will.

_**And then what?**_

> You get to decide if you keep doing this.

I'm not going to ret-con my blog. Instead, I'm just writing today's post. This post. I'm going to own my mistakes, deal with the fact that I won't finish this with 100 blog posts and keep marching forward. In the end, the number of posts doesn't matter; it's all about the process.
